# `create-mod`

> A lightweight(ish) CLI for scaffolding new Vortex extensions

## Installation

You don't actually need to, realistically. Just run `npm init create-mod` and `npm` will do the hard work of downloading and running the CLI.

If you really want to install it, just run `npm i -g create-mod` then run `create-mod` to get started.
